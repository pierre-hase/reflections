How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

One could see it more easily because only the differences between the files were pointed out. 

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

One can compare a working version and a version with a fail in it, to easily fix it. 

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

Because git is merely used for coding while google docs is rather used for text. 

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

One can go back to the version where no failure occured and can see the difference in there. 

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

For version control. What else?
